# TODO

- Add sfx for walking
- Add sfx for bumping into something
- Add gamepad vibration
- Add walljump
- Change sprites with a fancier version
- Make a real game map

# ISSUES
- pressing join button emits sound always
- When audioSource gameobject is in the scene and the scene gets unloaded it crushes
- jumping on other players allows to build momentum
